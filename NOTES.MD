- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such
  normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.

```
Min Max and Z score are normalization methods where the Min-Max provides an exact scale for all 
features but cannot handle the outliers. Unlike Min Max, Z score can handle the outliers but cannot
provide exact values for normalized data. Normalization methods are usually used for AI and machine learning 
to help the AI to distinguish between different values for the features.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? what
  is unit testing and why would we use it?

```
Unit testing is mainly used to test methods as units and is used for TDD Test Driven Development to construct 
a quality code from a given set of tests(this assignment somehow related to the TDD) while I don't have much
information about the required methods I am required to pass the test cases by implementing a suitable code.
In my opinion, is that the main advantage for JUnit (unit testing in general) is that it helps the programmer
to check his code for error in various test cases. To reduce the amount of work required from the Quality
assurance department. In an ideal case, the programmer finishes his task and validates it using unit testing,
then the code goes to the QA. The QA engineer revalidates the code and instead of starting from scratch,
he/she can add up to the existing test case to assure that the code satisfies the requirements.```

- What is the IDE did you use?

```
Intellij idea ultimate
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?

```
Java NIO
streams 
Functions
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is
  appreciated :D.

```
It was my first time dealing with CSV files. Also, I have been confused about which is the suitable 
rounding technique until I read the requirements. 
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file

```
provide an executable jar file which can be used from the command line
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how:

```
Yes, while I was attempting to finish the task, I learned to use the Java NIO library and BigDecimal and round them.
The task was a bit challenging which encouraged me to leave everything to stay focused on passing
the test cases. Also, I took the opportunity to implement the code to the best of my knowledge and spent
a lot of time refactoring the code and then refactoring it again to make it as clean as possible. 
finally, I employed the TDD basis of passing test case, refactor, repeat.
